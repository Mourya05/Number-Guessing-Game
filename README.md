# Number-Guessing-Game
The `Number_Guessing_Game` program is a simple console-based Java game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Utilizing the `Scanner` class for user input, the program provides up to 10 attempts per round to correctly guess the number, offering feedback after each guess—whether it's too low, too high, or correct. If the player guesses the number within the allowed attempts, they win; otherwise, the correct number is revealed. After each round, players are given the option to play again or exit the game. The program demonstrates basic programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and user interaction, creating an engaging and dynamic experience.
